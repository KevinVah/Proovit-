# How to operate the page
1. Open index.html 

2. Make a travel route selection from the list and click "filter"

3. You can also filter the list by clicking on "Route" "Flight" or "Total Price". 

4. Destination tab does not work. At first had an idea that I would do a seperate page for travelling but changed my mind. So left Destination tab there because otherwise navigation bar looked empty.
5. Currently the project is missing a reservation part since it came out to be quite complicated and I would've required definitely a week more since I am only able to work on this project a few hours a day but if you really require reservation part, I can definitely try.
This was definitely the most fun I've ever had with a project, especially javascript part (travel logic).
